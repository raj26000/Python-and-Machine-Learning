# Python-and-Machine-Learning
Source Codes for various ML tasks and algorithms I implement in spare time. Also, some random code musings in python :)

Dataset Sources:
1. RandomForest Regression Task: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/
(Analytics Vidhya Hackathon)

2. Classification of Loan Eligibility: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/
(Analytics Vidhya Hackathon: Final accuracy on Test Data = 0.7986)

3. Flu Shot Learning: Predict whether a person received their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.

5. CASCADE CUP '22: (Team of 2 - Nerdy Duo)

      Round-1: Data Science Quiz.   
      Scored 31.75/40 and ranked 4th among all participating teams. Qualified to next round.

      Round-2: Machine Learning Hackathon on Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/cascade-cup-22)
      Challenge to predict rider driven cancellation of orders, evaluated using ROC-AUC. Code has been attached. Finished 23 out of 198 teams and qualified to next round. Training       file is too large to upload; find it in the challenge link, test file and metadata uploaded. 
      
      Round-3: EDA and Data Analysis Report.
      Prepared a data analysis report on train_data and call_data (metadata) provided. Code for the same is attached as well, along with the report.
